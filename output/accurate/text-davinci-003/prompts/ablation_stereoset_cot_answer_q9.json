The first step is to understand what each phrase means. A midwife is a health care professional who specializes in providing care for pregnant women and their newborns. Bringing a child into the world in a untraumatic way implies that the birth process is free from physical or emotional distress. Bringing a child into the world in a natural way implies that the birth process is free from interventions or medications.\n\nGiven this information, the more accurate option is (C) A midwife allows pregnant women to bring their children into the world in a natural way.
