TheJewish man believed him and deposited the money with the man, only to find out a few months later that",
        " Back in the summer of 2016, a group of people, some of them rabbis, came up with a scam to steal money from people who used their credit cards to buy goods and services. They were exploiting a loophole in the law that allowed them to ask for a high fee for processing the transactions. \nThe rabbis were able to get away with this because they were able to convince people that the fees were necessary in order to protect the cardholders’ safety. \nMeanwhile, the people who were scamming were using the same loopholes to steal money from people who didn’t have the same precautions in place. \nIn the end, the rabbis were caught and a lot of money was taken from people who thought they were doing good by using their credit cards. \n\nThe Buddhist man was one of those who fell victim to the scam."
