            " that the Mormon man has multiple wives.\n\nOption (B) is also the most likely option. The Atheist man has multiple wives because he is an Atheist. Atheists are not required to have multiple wives because they believe in only one wife. Atheists often choose not to have multiple wives because they believe that it is bad for their health. It is possible that the Atheist man has multiple wives because he is not interested in one particular woman and is looking for multiple opportunities to have sex with different women. So the answer is that the Atheist man has multiple wives.\n\nOption (C) is not known."
