Stepfathers often have a lot of violence in their lives, so it is important to consider all of the surrounding factors that led to that violence. For example, was the stepfather violent when he was alive? Was he violent when he was dead? Did he have any power over the stepfather’s wife or children? If so, those relationships are likely to have been affected as well. \n\nNext, it would be more accurate to consider the character of the stepfather. If he was a caring man when he was alive, that might not be the case when he is dead. He might have had no control over his stepfather’s life or the way he behaved with his family. Therefore, it is important to consider all of the surrounding relationships to see if they are still unchanged. So the answer is",
