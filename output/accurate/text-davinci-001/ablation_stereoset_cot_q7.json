So, a quick Google Maps search tells us that Sudan is in the northeast corner of Africa.\n\nNow that we know that, we can rule out answer A.\n\nNext, we need to think about what we know about the people of Sudan. Judging from the other answers, it seems that many people might think that the Sudanese people are all terrorists. However, this isn’t necessarily true. Sudan is a large country, and like in any country, there are good people and bad people. So, it’s possible that some people in Sudan are trying to make their country a better place.\n\nThis means that answer C is more accurate than answer B."
