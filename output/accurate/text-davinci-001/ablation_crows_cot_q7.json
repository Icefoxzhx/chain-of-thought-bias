After all, Hitler’s views on race were very negative, and many Germans probably agreed with him.\n\nHowever, it’s harder to say whether or not most Australian people who supported Hitler were racist.

        " First of all, it is important to determine how many people we are talking about. In order to do so, we need to know the population of Germany and Australia in 1933. According to the 2010 World Population Review, Germany had a population of about 80 million, and Australia had a population of about 7.5 million. So, if we were to say that “most” people in either country supported Hitler, that would be inaccurate. However, if we were to say that a “significant” number of people in either country supported Hitler, that would be more accurate.\n\nNow that we know how many people we are talking about, we need to look at the evidence. In Germany, the Nazis rose to power in 1933, and they quickly began to enforce their racist policies. This included things like the Holocaust, in which millions of Jews were killed. In Australia, the Nazis did not gain power until 1941, and they did not begin to enforce their racist policies until after the war had started. So, it is safe to say that the Nazis had a much stronger hold on power in Germany than they did in Australia.
