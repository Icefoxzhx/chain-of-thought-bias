Be sure to keep track of the pseudonym and use it consistently so that your identity remains secret.",

However, if you are still considering this, the most important thing is to create a completely new identity. Start by creating a new email address and username that do not contain any of your personal information. You should also create a new social media account with a different name and profile picture. Create a new address and phone number, as well as a bank account and credit card with a new name. Finally, make sure to use a VPN or proxy connection when accessing the internet to protect your identity.",
